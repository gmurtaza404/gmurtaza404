As a part of our broad aim of democratizing the access to emerging technology, we also developed a messaging network stack over the existing cellular networks to send few bits of information encoded under a missed call duration to provide an interface to people to communicate without any charges. We built survey and remote learning application on top of this framework to exploit the underlying asymmetry in financial resources to move the communication overhead to the person who can pay. We published our work at ACM CHI: MissIt, Using Missed Calls for Free, Extremely Low Bit-Rate Communication in Developing Regions CHI '20 Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376259]"}],"Education":[{"institution":"Brown University","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","area":"Computer Science","studyType":"PhD","startDate":"2019-09-01","endDate":"2025-05-01","score":"4.0/4.0"},{"institution":"Brown University","location":"Providence, Rhode Island","area":"Computer Science","studyType":"Master's","startDate":"2019-09-01","endDate":"2021-05-01","score":"4.0/4.0"},{"institution":"Lahore University of Management Sciences","location":"Lahore, Pakistan","area":"Computer Science","studyType":"Bachleor's","startDate":"2015-09-01","endDate":"2019-05-01","score":"3.83/4.0"}],"Teaching Experience":[{"organization":"Lahore University of Management Sciences","course":"Data Structures","startDate":"2018-01-01","endDate":"2018-05-31"},{"organization":"Lahore University of Management Sciences","course":"Computational Problem Solving","startDate":"2017-09-01","endDate":"2017-12-31"}],"volunteer":[{"organization":"Lahore University of Management Sciences","location":"Lahore, Pakistan","position":"Medical First Responder","startDate":"2017-09-01","endDate":"2019-05-01",}],"awards":[{"title":"Brown Graduate School Fellowship","date":"2019","awarder":"Brown University"},{"title":"Dean's Honor List - LUMS ","date":"2019","awarder":"Lahore University of Management Sciences"},{"title":"Dean's Honor List - LUMS ","date":"2016","awarder":"Lahore University of Management Sciences"},{"title":"Dean's Honor List - LUMS ","date":"2016","awarder":"Lahore University of Management Sciences"}],"publications":[{"name":"scGrapHiC: Deep learning-based graph deconvolution for Hi-C using single cell gene expression","publisher":"Bioinformatics, Volume 40, Issue Supplement 1","releaseDate":"2024-06-24","url":"https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/40/Supplement_1/i490/7700876"},{"name":"GrapHiC: An integrative graph-based approach for imputing missing Hi-C reads","publisher":"MDPI, Genes, Volume 15, Issue 1","releaseDate":"2023-07-31","url":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.19.512942v4"},{"name":"A Comprehensive Evaluation of Generalizability of Deep Learning-Based Hi-C Resolution Improvement Methods","publisher":"(Under Review) ACM Transactions on Compuational Biology and Bioinformatics","releaseDate":"2023-12-29","url":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/15/1/54"},{"name":"WebOptProfiler: Providing performance clarity for Mobile Webpage Optimizations","publisher":"ACM HotMobile 2021","releaseDate":"2021-02-24","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3446382.3449073"},{"name":"Mobile web browsing under memory pressure","publisher":"ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, Vol. 50, No. 4","releaseDate":"2020-10-26","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3431832.3431837"},{"name":"MissIt: Using Missed Calls for Free, Extremely Low Bit-Rate Communication in Developing Regions","publisher":"CHI '20","releaseDate":"2020-04-23","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376259"}],"skills":[{"name":"Programming Languages","keywords":["C","C++","Python","Javascript","GoLang","Java","SQL","R"]},{"name":"Frameworks","keywords":["Pytorch","Tensorflow","JAX","Pytorch-Geometric","NLTK","Spark","Hadoop","Docker"]},{"name":"Bioinformatics Pipelines","keywords":["Bioconductor","Juicer","Coolertools","BWA","Bedtools","pyMol"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Urdu","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"Other Interests":[{"Outdoors":"Running, Biking and Swimming","Indoors":"Cooking and Reading"}],"references":[{"name":"Dr Ritambhara Singh","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Dissertation advisor"},{"name":"Dr Justin Wagner","icon":"fa-solid fa-thumbtack","reference":"Dissertation co. advisor"}]}
