      description: Developed a causal model for web page loading process that provided detailed performance insights into interactions between the device hardware, network conditions, webpage content and optimizations. Published our system and findings at HotMobile2021 [https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3446382.3449073].
    - title: Research Assistant
      institution: Lahore University of Management Sciences
      year: 2018 - 2019
      description: I was working under Dr Ihsan Ayyub Qazi to quantify the impact of memory bottlenecks in context of low-end devices in developing regions. We published our findings at ACM SIGCOMM CCR [https://ccronline.sigcomm.org/2020/ccr-october-2020/mobile-web-browsing-under-memory-pressure/]. As a part of our broad aim of democratizing the access to emerging technology, we also developed a messaging network stack over the existing cellular networks to send few bits of information encoded under a missed call duration to provide an interface to people to communicate without any charges. We built survey and remote learning application on top of this framework to exploit the underlying asymmetry in financial resources to move the communication overhead to the person who can pay. We published our work at ACM CHI MissIt, Using Missed Calls for Free, Extremely Low Bit-Rate Communication in Developing Regions CHI '20 Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems [https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376259]

- title: Currently Advising

  contents:
    - **Winston Li** - We are developing  a continuous learning framework that imposes strict structure in the latent space to improve meta-label learning when extrapolating to unseen tasks.
    - **Byron Butaney** - We are building a benchmarking framework that tests whether the Large Language Model (LLM) style scRNA-seq models can correctly assemble cells based on i) cell-cycle phases (structure) ii) spatial positing and iii) temporal cell-differentiation trajectories.
    - **Wangdrak Dorji** -  We are developing a novel protein representation that embeds dynamical properties of proteins through Anistropic Network Model (ANM). We show that by including dynamical properties we can improve protein-protein interactions accuracy performance in comparison to representations that rely solely on structure or sequence.
