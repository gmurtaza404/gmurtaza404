I am a sixth-year Ph.D. student (expected graduation date of spring 2025) at Brown University, and Dr. Ritambhara Singh currently advises me. I am interested in developing graph-based representations that combine (both bulk and single-cell) sequential genomic measurements with structural measurements that allow us to solve various downstream tasks. For my research, I typically develop graph-based deep-learning frameworks, and recently, I have been pretraining backbone models that align sequential and structural genomics data modalities in a shared representation space using contrastive learning-based approaches. 

I also worked with Theophilus Benson at Brown, where I built an internet-scale benchmarking platform to causally identify bottlenecks in the webpage loading process. 

Before joining Brown, I was at Lahore University of Management Sciences, where I earned my bachelor's in computer science. I was also involved in various research projects aimed at ensuring fair and equal access to resources available on the Internet.
