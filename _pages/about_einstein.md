I am a sixth year Ph.D. student (expected graduation date of spring 2025) at Brown University and I am currently advised by [](Dr. Ritambhara Singh). I am interested in developing graph based representations that join both bulk and single cell sequential genomic measurements with structural measurements that allow us to holistically solve a wide array of downstream tasks. For my research I typically develop Graph neural networks to model structure and recently I have been building semi-supervised that align sequential and structural in a shared representation space using contrastive learning based approaches. 

At Brown I have also worked with Theophillus Benson, during that time I was building an internet scale benchmarking platform to understand bottlenecks in webpage loading process. 

Before joining Brown, I was at Lahore University of Management sciences where I did my bachleors in computer science and I was also involved in various research projects various projects under the broad umbrella of trying to ensure fair and equal access to resources available on the internet.
